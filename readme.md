## general notes
Originally inspired by Wes Bos' [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/). the aim of this repo is just to do a couple of smaller exercises to keep my GH-profile active. Some days I just don't feel like undertaking a big project, or I've hit a wall with my current project and I just want to take a break, but I'm not doing nothing and so here I'll be testing out pieces of code as well as doing smaller challenges or exercises just to keep the juices flowing.

There is no live preview, this is more for me than anyone else, but there will be smaller projects in the directory that may or may not contain links to live previews, more on that as it progresses.
